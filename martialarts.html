			<h1>Martial Arts</h1>

			<section>
				<h2>Karate</h2>

				<article>
					<p>In large part due to The Karate Kid, I was always enamored with martial arts. I took karate for about a year and a half while in high school; I loved it and earned a brown belt. It did wonders for my self-confidence, but I ultimately had to make the hard decision to give it up to play baseball and basketball.</p>

				<h2>Tae Kwon Do</h2>

					<h3>Training</h3>
					<p>As an adult, I joined a Tae Kwon Do class with 5 of my kids and loved every minute of it. I was determined to achieve my childhood dream of earning a black belt.</p>
					<p>The journey was not without its challenges, though. In addition to breaking lots of boards, I broke a few toes along the way. The biggest hurdle, however, was coming back from breaking my fibula in two places while sparring during a belt test.</p>

					<p>I worked hard to rehab and get back on track, eventually achieving my goal by earning a black belt at 41 years old. I then went a step further and earned my 2nd degree black belt.

					<p>Part of the final test required breaking 4 pieces of wood -- one with each arm and each leg. But I've never been one to do the minimum, so I taped boards together, broke a total of 8 pieces of wood, and threw in some concrete for good measure.</p>

					<h3>Teaching</h3>
					<p>Combining my passions for martial arts and <a href="family.html#fostering">children in foster care</a>, I had the opportunity to assist and then take over teaching a tae kwon do class at a group home for a few years. Unfortunately, that ended with covid lockdowns.
