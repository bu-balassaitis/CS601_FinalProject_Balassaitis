				<p>I'm a lifelong Philadelphia pro sports fan. I pay for subscriptions to be able to watch my teams from out of state.</p>

				<p>While no single season tops the one that culminated in the Eagles defeating Tom Brady and the Patriots with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XmhBaUdges&ab_channel=PhiladelphiaEagles" target="_blank">the greatest play in Super Bowl history <img src="./assets/images/external_link_icon.png" alt="External Link Icon" height="16" width="16"></a> in 2018, 2022 was the most fun I season I can remember as a Philly fan.</p>

						<h2>Eagles</h2>

						<p>By just about any metric, the Eagles had a great 2022 season. They were the last undefeated team and they held the best record in the NFL wire-to-wire. </p>

						<p>After earning a first-round bye in the playoffs, they dominated the next two rounds on the way to a heavyweight Super Bowl matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs. Although they led most of the game, the Chiefs were unstoppable in the second half and kicked the game-winning field goal as time expired.</p>

						<h2>Phillies</h2>

						<p>The Philles' 2022 season was quite a rollercoaster. After making few major off-season acquisitions each of the past few years, expectations were high heading into the season. But it didn't play out as expected.</p>


						<p>Two major injuries to reigning MVP Bryce Harper threatened to derail the season. First, he injured his UCL, which prevented him from playing defense and would ultimately require Tommy John surgery. Thankfully, the National League implemented the designated hitter that year, so Harper was able to bat without having to play the field. Then, in late June, he suffered a broken thumb after being hit by a pitch and missed two months.</p>

						<p>After a slow start to the season, the Phillies fired their manager and promptly began winning at a rapid clip to turn the season around. They scuffled a bit toward the end of the season, just barely making the playoffs with the added 3rd wild card slot (a second recent rule change that greatly benefitted them).</p>

						<p>But they got hot at the right time, defeating 3 heavily-favored opponents in a dominant playoff run, led by Bryce Harper's timely hitting. They even took a 2-1 lead in the World Series against the vaunted Astros, but, sadly, were shut down by incredible pitching after that and lost the series. They did not win the ultimate prize, but they provided an unexpectedly-thrilling playoff ride that I will not soon forget.</p>

						<h2>76ers</h2>

						<p>After a trade for James Harden in the middle of last season, the rapid emergence of Tyrese Maxey, and a few acquisitions to bolster the bench, expectations were high for the Sixers heading into this season. Unfortunately, they dealt with several injuries to top players early in the season and got off to a sluggish 12-12 start.</p>

						<p>However, from that point on, they were among the winningest teams in the NBA the rest of the way and entered the playoffs strong. They dominated the first round of the playoffs and sat for a week and a half waiting for the rest of the first round series to finish. This break was fortuitous, since their star player, league MVP Joel Embiid, suffered an LCL injury in game 3.</p>

						<p>The Sixers were able to win game 4 in the first round to set up another reprisal of the most commonly-played matchup in NBA playoff history against the Boston Celtics. The Celtics were a title favorite coming into the season and have knocked the Sixers out of the playoffs several times in recent years, so the odds were in their favor.</p>

						<p>Embiid's injury should have needed 4-6 weeks to recover, but he came back in less than 2 weeks. The team surprisingly won game 1 in Boston without him, but the rust was evident as they were blown out in game 2. After a back-and-forth series, the Sixers won a thriller in Boston in game 5 to take a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series.</p>

						<p>Game 6 was back and forth. The Sixers took an 83-81 lead, 6 minutes away from knocking off their playoff nemesis. But the next 5.5 minutes was a massive choke, as they were held to a single point while the Celtics opened up a comfortable lead and won the game going away. A golden opportunity was wasted on their home court.</p>

						<p>So it was back to Boston for game 7. It was an ugly first half for the Sixers, but they stayed within 3 points. They tied it up early in the 3rd quarter, but then...<em>I don't think I'll be able to talk about what happened after that until I seek therapy.</em></p>

						<p>Despite the bitter ending, the season was a fun journey and included an exciting (albeit short) playoff run. It just ended in jarring fashion that will leave a cloud hanging over them until further playoff success can be achieved.</p>
