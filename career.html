				<h2>Early Career</h2>
				<article>
					<p>I was fortunate to be able to dive into several great work opportunities before I was even done collage, thanks to the <a href="education.html#co-op">cooperative education facet</a> of Drexel University's IT degree program.</p>
					<p>In addition to gaining experience in the university's research lab, I worked for a small IT consulting company for all 3 co-op cycles. That company sent me out on contract and I gained experience in two fortune 500 companies.</p>
					<p>One of them, The Vanguard Group, hired me full-time after my junior year and offered to pay for the rest of my classes if I took them at night while working full-time during the day.</p>
					<p>It was there that I met a co-worker there who helped open the door for me to write articles for a technical journal focused on Lotus Notes, a no-sql document store with it's own custom application development platform and some unique features that made it very prevalent in financial giants and government agencies, among many other organizations.</p>

					<h2>Consulting Experience</h2>
					<p>Vanguard was a great place to work, but the downside of that was that people rarely left the company and I didn't see any room to move up. So, after a few years, I started a job search and went back to working for consulting firms.</p>
					<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in consulting and quickly found that it was a good way to make better money. There's pressure, because every hour is counted and clients want to save money and meet deadlines, but I thrived on the excitement and it pushed me to stay on top of the technology I was working with.</p>
					<p>I enjoyed the variety of industries and projects. I also enjoyed the fact that most of my projects were building brand new applications from scratch, which I would then turn over and move on to something else new. It also afforded me the ability to work from home as needed as far back as 2001. I have primarily lived in New Jersey and Florida, but I've worked for companies based in Philadelphia, New York, Atlanta, and Chicago.</p>

					<h2>IBM Champion</h2>
					<p>One of the best parts of working in consulting is that it allowed me to work with several of the top experts in my field. Since I've changed projects frequently in the consulting world, I have always looked for ways to achieve things that I could put on my resume that most people would not be able to include.</p>
					<p>To that end, I had written some technical articles and created some practice tests for certifications early in my career. But from 2011-2019, I worked for two of the top groups in my industry, and working with some top experts in my field inspired me to take it to another level.</p>
					<p>When IBM Notes added the XPages (JSF) component-based web front end, I was near the forefront of learning all about it's built-in features and figuring out how to incorporate other libraries and APIs into it. I started a blog and posted several times per week, providing development tips and tricks. I published over 20 articles in technical magazines. I was then invited to deliver a few webinars, speak at some regional conferences, and then speak at IBM Connect -- the largest conference worldwide focused on IBM Notes and XPages</p>
					<p><mark>All of these efforts led to being named an <em><a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/ibmchampions/prweb13110816.htm" target="_blank">IBM Champion <img src="./assets/images/external_link_icon.png" alt="External Link Icon" height="16" width="16"></a></em></mark> (one of roughly 100 worldwide in my field) in 2014, 2015, and 2016.</p>

					<h2>Major Technology Shift</h2>

					<p>Lotus (and later IBM) Notes was a great rapid application development platform -- especially after adding the XPages JSF front end. I could build truly custom applications with client/server and/or web interfaces with complex security models and the ability to work offline and replicate data whenever connected. All of this could be done way faster than with any other technology stack.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, IBM let it wither on the vine and rapidly lost market share, so work opportunities dried up. The writing was on the wall that my skillset needed to make a major shift to stay marketable. Fortunately, the platform had a fair amount of Java integration and used an Eclipse IDE, so I leaned into that experience and aimed at getting a job in that area.</p>
					<p>I was fortunate to land a great job at <a href="http://www.availity.com" target="_blank">Availity <img src="./assets/images/external_link_icon.png" alt="External Link Icon" height="16" width="16"></a> a Healthcare IT company and, for the past few years, have been working primarily with Java and MySQL. It continues to be a major learning curve, but I have enjoyed the ability to learn new things and gain skills that are much more widely marketable now.
