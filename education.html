					<h2>Drexel University</h2>

						<p>After high school, I enrolled at <a href="https://drexel.edu/" target="_blank">Drexel University <img src="./assets/images/external_link_icon.png" alt="External Link Icon" height="16" width="16"></a> in Philadelphia.</p>
						<p>I chose Drexel for these reasons:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>They had a new college of Information Science and Technology, which was not common in the mid-1990s</li>
							<li>Coooperative Education provided the opportunity to gain real-world experience while in school</li>
							<li>Proximity -- I wasn't interested on going away to school and the 25-minute drive made it easily commutable</li>
						</ul>

					<article id="co-op">
						<h4>Cooperative Education</h4>
						<p>The co-op program was excellent. Bachelor degree programs are typically 4 years, but the co-op program was a 5-year degree, with time built-in to gain work experience in order to start building a resume and get a head start over other graduates.</p>
						<p>In the middle 3 years, students would work for 6 months and go to school for 6 months. (The semesters run on a quarterly schedule to make this work.)</p>
						<p>It was a tremendous experience to go through the process of applying, interviewing, and then gaining real-world experience while still in school. It also provided a much better income than minimum wage work.</p>
						<p>I ended up getting hired full-time after my third co-op cycle and my employer offered to pay my tuition as I finished up my senior year of classes at night.</p>

						<h4>ALN</h4>
						<p>During my third year as an undergraduate, I had the opportunity to work in my college's research lab, where the graduate students and a few professors were building what was among the very first online learning programs, dubbed the <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/1995/10/01/asynchronous-learning-networks-drexels-experience.aspx?m=1" target="_blank">Asynchronous Learning Network (ALN) <img src="./assets/images/external_link_icon.png" alt="External Link Icon" height="16" width="16"></a>.</p>
						<p>This program provided remote students the opportunity to earn a Master of Science in Information Systems completely online, circa 1995. This courses were built with Lotus Notes. The experience I gained here launched my career developing with the Notes platform.</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h4>Graduation</h4>
						<p>I was originally scheduled to graduate in 1999, but because I completed my senior year of classes at night while working full-time -- and also because of a car accident that necessitated two spinal surgeries -- I completed my studies and graduated in the spring of 2001, finishing at the top of my class with 4.0 GPA.</p>

					<article>
						<p>I am currently enrolled in the MS in Software Development program at <a href="http://www.bu.edu" target="_blank">BU <img src="./assets/images/external_link_icon.png" alt="External Link Icon" height="16" width="16"></a>. I chose this program for several reasons:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Excellent academic reputation</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/boston-university-OCIT0007/computer-information-technology" target="_blank">High ranking <img src="./assets/images/external_link_icon.png" alt="External Link Icon" height="16" width="16"></a> of the online master's program</li>
							<li>Uniqueness of the degree in software development and not just CS or IT</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>I'm spreading the courses out so I can maximize the amount that my employer will pay. I have completed 20 credits so far, including the following courses:</p>
						<table>
							<thead>
								<tr>
									<th>Course #</th>
									<th>Course Title</th>
